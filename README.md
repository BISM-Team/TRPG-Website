# TRPG-Website

A complete Website for playing Tabletop Role Playing Games with friends, with features ranging from running Campaigns with music and interactive 3D/2D battle maps, to sharing lore and information with players with a GM-created World Wiki for the players to consult and enrichen with new information, and of course Character creation and tools for adding any Homebrew content needed very easily. 

The Homebrew system is designed to make adding new classes, races, spells, ecc.. very simple; but also adding a entirely new game system of your choice is as easy as defining a new character model and adding classes and races.
